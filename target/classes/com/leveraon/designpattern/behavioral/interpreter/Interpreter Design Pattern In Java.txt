Interpreter pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern and is used to defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar. The best example of this pattern is java compiler that interprets the java source code into byte code that is understandable by JVM. Google Translator is also an example of interpreter pattern where the input can be in any language and we can get the output interpreted in another language.
